I really like the blog post [Computers Can Be Understood](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/).

It's all about how any software, no matter how complicated it looks, can be figured out. I like it because it pushes back on the whole idea of treating tech as a "black box." The author's point is that computers are just logic all the way down, so you can always dig in and understand what's happening. That idea really hit me. It made me realize that being intimidated by a complex system is more of a choice than a fact. It's not just for super experts to read source code or check out the documentation. It's actually a super practical way to fix things. It also made me think about how I learn stuff and encouraged me to stop being scared and start exploring when I run into something I don't get. One caveat is that maybe with the LLMs nowadays it can be argued that AI is unable to be fully understood and that we do need to treat somethings like a black box, although we are making significant progress in understanding how LLMs work at a deeper level.

What I like about this piece is how it flips the mindset—tech doesn’t have to be a “mystery,” it’s just layers you can dig into. Even if stuff like LLMs feels more black-boxy, the same spirit applies: you can still poke around, experiment, and learn instead of getting intimidated.
